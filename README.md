## Purpose of This Project
- I wanted to have more practical experience in creating web applications with Next.js and started learning it with [the Messenger Clone tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGPGcKBpAk8) on YouTube. Thank you for the awesome tutorial, [Antonio](https://www.youtube.com/@codewithantonio)!
