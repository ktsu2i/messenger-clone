# Messenger Clone

## Purpose of This Project
- I wanted to have more practical experience in creating web applications with Next.js and started learning it with [the Messenger Clone tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGPGcKBpAk8) on YouTube. Thank you for the awesome tutorial, [Antonio](https://www.youtube.com/@codewithantonio)!
- Nowadays, a lot of applications have real-time technologies such as DMs. I believe that it is essential to know how to implement the real-time systems in web applications.
